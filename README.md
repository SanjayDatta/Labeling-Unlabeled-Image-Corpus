# Labeling-Unlabeled-Image-Corpus
## Abstract: Efficient Labeling of Unlabeled images 
### **Overall ~87% accuracy was achieved on an unlabeled image corpus (10440) at 5% manual labeling effort**

The balance 13% error images can be corrected 1 by 1 in a targeted manner to take labeling accuracy to 100%. A work flow has been provided to do it correctly and efficiently. 

### **So with 18% (~5 + ~13) effort, an image corpus can be labeled 100% accurately.**
